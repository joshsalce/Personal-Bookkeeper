# Personal-Bookkeeper

I love to read books. During the initial lockdowns from COVID-19, I began to make the goal of reading one book a week a reality. This is an application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation that helps readers keep track of books that I will either buy later, or to log books that I have read.

The home page contains a button that opens a modal for the user to input the author, title, subject, and price of a book. Hit submit, and the input is taken from a form to the table that is on the home page. For formatting purposes, the title is returned in a truncated form to minimize awkward formatting in the table. In addition to the input, a span is added to the table, where the user can delete the book from the table by clicking that switch.
